### ü¶Ä Step 2: Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

This will install the following tools:

- `rustup` ‚Äî Rust installer and version manager  
- `cargo` ‚Äî Rust's build system and package manager  
- `rustc` ‚Äî The Rust compiler

---

## 2. Clone the Repository and Run the Project

Open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Git Bash), then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
cargo run
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The first `cargo run` may take a while as it compiles dependencies.

Once it's built, you can open `src/main.rs` in your code editor to configure or customize the logic as needed.
